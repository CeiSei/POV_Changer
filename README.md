# POV_Changer

## About this project
-----------------------
Images are normally static, that means they do not provide dynamic views. By using perspective transformation, this project can make several point-of-views from one image.

## How does it work?
-----------------------
1. First, you have to prepare the image. Put your file's directory in variable 'filename'.

2. After executing the program, choose six points in the image which is the main composition.
   !!! Important !!!
   Please choose six points in order. 


This project has two functions.

(1) POV-Change

- By using '-' or '=', project shows you some different angle of the image. 
- To rotate your POV clockwise, press '-' on your keyboard. 
- To rotate your POV counter-clockwise, press '=' on your keyboard.

(2) Interpolation

- By using '[' or ']', project can reduce errors in image.
- To reduce black area on the image, press ']' on your keyboard.
- To reduce boundary on the image, press '[' on your keyboard.
